ABSTRACT

Our goal is to investigate the integration of self-report and neurophysiological data in a new measurement
system. Multi-sensor and multimodal methods were used through individual longitudinal follow-ups at one-week
intervals across three sessions. We tracked individuals' scores to analyze their evolution over time and establish
meaningful correlations within each participant. Psychometric tests such as Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
(HADS) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S) were used to correlate self-report measures of anxiety and
depression with neurophysiological measures. Control psychometric measures such as 10-Item Big Five Inventory
(BFI-10), STAI-T, and Fear Questionnaire (FQ) were also included. We collected raw data from eye-tracking and
heart rate variability (HRV) sensors from (n=10) participants resulting in a comprehensive dataset used for data
analysis. The study found high interindividual variability and low intraindividual variability, indicating that while
individual participants maintain consistent responses across sessions, there are significant differences between
participants. This highlights the need for personalized approaches in psychological assessments.
